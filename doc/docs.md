## context.proto
This group of objects represent concepts that are interacting, presenting, enclosing, or are 
otherwise relating to the world in which impressions live. These include the user, their device,
their location, the channel (e.g., site, app, digital out-of-home) with which they are 
interacting, the channel&#39;s publisher, its content, and any regulations that are in effect
(e.g., COPPA, GDPR).


<a name="context.Content"/>

### Content
This object describes the content in which an impression can appear, which may be syndicated or 
non-syndicated content. This object may be useful when syndicated content contains impressions 
and does not necessarily match the publisher&#39;s general content. An exchange may or may not have 
knowledge of the page where the content is running as a result of the syndication method (e.g., 
a video impression embedded in an iframe on an unknown web property or device).

This can include mechanical information (e.g., sizes, supported mime types and other rendering 
options), placement details and positioning, various restrictions lists (e.g., advertiser 
domains, content categories), and more.


<a name="placement.Placement"/>

### Placement

be rendering within them. Placements of all types begin with this object as their root. It 
contains one or more subtype objects (i.e., &#34;display&#34;, &#34;video&#34;, &#34;audio&#34;) that define the kinds of
media permitted as well as media specific placement behaviors.

The other attributes in this object apply to all aspects and substructures of the placement
(i.e., the same block lists, language, secure status, etc. apply to all media types and native 
assets as applicable).
